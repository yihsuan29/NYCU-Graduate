# Project Overview

## Lab 1 – Backpropagation
Implements a simple neural network trained via backpropagation to perform binary classification on linear and XOR datasets, analyzing the effects of learning rate, hidden units, and activation functions.

## Lab 2 – Binary Semantic Segmentation
Applies deep learning–based semantic segmentation to perform pixel-wise binary classification of foreground versus background in images.

## Lab 3 – MaskGIT for Image Inpainting
Implements MaskGIT with multi-head self-attention and MVTM to perform image inpainting from masked inputs, optimized using the minGPT training strategy.

## Lab 4 – Conditional VAE for Video Prediction
Uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder with teacher forcing and KL annealing to predict future video frames conditioned on an initial frame and pose labels.

## Lab 5 – Value-Based Reinforcement Learning
Implements DQN, Double DQN, Prioritized Experience Replay, and multi-step returns to solve CartPole and Atari Pong environments with improved sample efficiency.

## Lab 6 – Generative Models (Conditional DDPM)
Implements a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model to generate multi-label conditioned images on the iCLEVR dataset.

## Lab 7 – Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning
Implements A2C and PPO algorithms to solve Pendulum and Walker2d environments and evaluates multiple optimization techniques for improving PPO performance.

## Fianl Project: Multi-Gate Stock Transformer
A transformer-based model for stock price prediction that leverages expanded market, industry, and news features to improve gating and forecasting performance over the original MASTER model.
