# Project Overview

## Homework 1: Fundamentals of MDPs and Policy Gradient
Implementation and empirical comparison of REINFORCE, REINFORCE with baseline, and REINFORCE with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) using neural policy approximators on CartPole-v0 and LunarLander-v2 environments.

## Homework 2: DDPG, TRPO, and PPO
Implementation of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for continuous control tasks, evaluated on Pendulum-v0 and extended to the HalfCheetah MuJoCo locomotion environment.

## Homework 3: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
In-depth implementation and analysis of the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, following the original pseudocode and applied to Pendulum-v1 and HalfCheetah-v5 environments.

## Final Project: Optimizing Rice Palatability in Taiwan via Reinforcement Learning
Development of a simulation-based reinforcement learning framework using gym-DSSAT and real-world agricultural data to optimize rice palatability while balancing yield, sustainability, and resource efficiency in Taiwan.
